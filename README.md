# Email Spam Detection

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to detect spam emails by analyzing patterns and features in the email content. The model improves inbox accuracy and enhances security by filtering out unwanted spam emails.

## Features

- **Spam Detection:** Accurately identifies and filters out spam emails.
- **Pattern Analysis:** Analyzes content features like text, sender information, and metadata.
- **Machine Learning:** Trained on a dataset of emails to differentiate between spam and legitimate emails.
- **Scalable:** Can be integrated into various email platforms and services.
